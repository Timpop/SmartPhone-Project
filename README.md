#Backgroun
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see example here . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. This project will utilize data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone collected by the University of California (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
